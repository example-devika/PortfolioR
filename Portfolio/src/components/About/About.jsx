        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I embarked on my professional journey with a specialization in
          Electrical and Electronics Engineering (E.E.E), but my insatiable
          curiosity and passion for web development led me to a new and exciting
          path in the development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proficient in a range of web technologies, including HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript, Node.JS and frameworks like Bootstrap, React.Js . I'm on a
          constant quest to expand my knowledge and push the envelope of what's
          achievable online.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a recent graduate, I bring fresh perspectives, a hunger for
          learning, and a commitment to excellence to every project I undertake.
          Whether it's optimizing performance, enhancing user experiences, or
          designing eye-catching interfaces, I'm dedicated to delivering web
          solutions that leave a lasting impression.
